# PyBer_Analysis


# the purpose of the new analysis

Using python scrupts, panda, jupyter notebook, and matplotlib to create a variety of chart that showcase the relationship between the type of city, and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders and drivers by type of city. this data analysis and visualizations I create will help PyBer improve to access to ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.
 
Import your data into a Pandas DataFrame.
Merge your DataFrames.
Create chartsthat showcase the average fare versus the total number of rides with bubble size based on the total number of drivers for each city type, including urban, suburban, and rural.
Determine the mean, median, and mode for the following:
The total number of rides for each city type.
The average fares for each city type.
The total number of drivers for each city type.
