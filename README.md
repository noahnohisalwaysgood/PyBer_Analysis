# PyBer_Analysis


# the purpose of the new analysis

Using python scrupts, panda, jupyter notebook, and matplotlib to create a variety of chart that showcase the relationship between the type of city, and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders and drivers by type of city. this data analysis and visualizations I create will help PyBer improve to access to ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.
 
Import your data into a Pandas DataFrame.
Merge your DataFrames.
Create chartsthat showcase the average fare versus the total number of rides with bubble size based on the total number of drivers for each city type, including urban, suburban, and rural.
Determine the mean, median, and mode for the following:
The total number of rides for each city type.
The average fares for each city type.
The total number of drivers for each city type.

# Summary
* The total number of rides taken in urban cities is 3 times greater than in suburban cities and 13 times greater than in rural cities.
* The total number of drivers in urban cities is nearly 5 times greater than in suburban cities and nearly 31 times greater than in rural cities.
* In terms of the total revenue from fares, the urban cities make up nearly twice more than Suburban cities and nearly 9 times more than Rural cities.
* In terms of the Average Fare per Ride, the urban cities make nearly 27%, Suburban cities make nearly 35% and Rural cities makes nearly 39%.

* The Average Fare per Drivers in urban cities is 3.3 times lesser than rural cities and 2.3 times lesser than suburban cities

Average Fare per Ride in Rural cities have higher than Suburban and Urban. High cost of service might discourage customers to use the service. Urban cities have higher numbers of total rides but also higher numbers of total drivers than Rural cities and Suburban cities. Most revenue from fares comes from Urban cities. Suburban and Rural cities have relatively less opportunity. Therefore, in order to make extra revunue is that PyBer provides food delivery service to customers. As a result, PyBer creates more opportunity to the drivers so that PyBer can maintain the ride availability and create new market.
